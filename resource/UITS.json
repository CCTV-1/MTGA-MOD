The more you win, the more prizes you accumulate!",

        "oracleText": "We are happy to announce that you can now select your favorite printing of each card in your collection! Yes, this means you can select your favorite basic lands!\n\nMultiple printings for a single card are now collapsed down to a single entry. You can toggle the expand button on a card to see all the printings you have and toggle it again to close them up. From the expanded view you can tap on the heart to set a favorite, which is the printing the game will use by default. Your current favorite card is the first one used when you add it to your deck or when auto-adding lands.\n\nHere are a few tips and tricks to help you start selecting your Preferred Printing of cards:\n\n-- The easiest way to see this in action is to go to your collection, and sort to your lands.\n\n-- From there, expand a card by using the button displayed in the upper left of any card that has multiple printings.\n\n-- Select a favorite by clicking the heart button in the lower right corner of your favorite printing.\n\n-- If you do not have a favorite selected, it defaults to the newest printing of that card in your collection.\n\n-- If you would like a deck to NOT use your favorite, expand the list and select the printing you want for that deck.\n\n-- If you have less printings of your favorite than you use, the most recent printing is also used.\n\n-- Limited modes will keep the non-land cards to the ones in that set.
